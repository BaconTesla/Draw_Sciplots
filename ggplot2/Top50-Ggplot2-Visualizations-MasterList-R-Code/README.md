This is part 3 of a three part tutorial on ggplot2, an aesthetically pleasing (and very popular) graphics framework in R. This tutorial is primarily geared towards those having some basic knowledge of the R programming language and want to make complex and nice looking charts with R ggplot2.

- Part 1: Introduction to ggplot2, covers the basic knowledge about constructing simple ggplots and modifying the components and aesthetics.
- Part 2: Customizing the Look and Feel, is about more advanced customization like manipulating legend, annotations, multiplots with faceting and custom layouts
- Part 3: Top 50 ggplot2 Visualizations - The Master List, applies what was learnt in part 1 and 2 to construct other types of ggplots such as bar charts, boxplots etc.


## Top 50 ggplot2 Visualizations - The Master List
An effective chart is one that:

1. Conveys the right information without distorting facts.
2. Is simple but elegant. It should not force you to think much in order to get it.
3. Aesthetics supports information rather that overshadow it.
4. Is not overloaded with information.

The list below sorts the visualizations based on its primary purpose. Primarily, there are 8 types of objectives you may construct plots. So, before you actually make the plot, try and figure what findings and relationships you would like to convey or examine through the visualization. Chances are it will fall under one (or sometimes more) of these 8 categories.
